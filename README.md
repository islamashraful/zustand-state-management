# Zustand State Management

This project is a sample application for exploring the [**Zustand**](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) library, a minimalist yet powerful state management solution for React applications.

Moreover, it's the code implementation of a Medium article I wrote, [Simplifying State Management: Exploring Zustand as an Alternative to Context and Redux(maybe?)](https://betterprogramming.pub/simplifying-state-management-exploring-zustand-as-an-alternative-to-context-and-redux-maybe-7a61a6a732c5).

## Introduction

Zustand is a small, fast, and self-contained state management library for React applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage the state of your application with minimal boilerplate code. This project serves as a learning and experimentation platform for Zustand's capabilities.

## Features

- Demonstrates the basic usage of Zustand for state management in a React application.
- Provides an example of how to create, update, and access state using Zustand.
- Offers a simple project structure to get you started quickly.
- Provides examples on how to prevent unnecessary component re-rendering.
